    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to my profile! I am Abdullah Mashhadi, a dedicated individual
      passionate about the intersection of technology, education, and content
      creation. With a solid foundation in science and engineering, I pursued my
      education at Hamza Army Public School and College before delving into the
      dynamic world of Computer Science at NUST-SEECS. Driven by a curiosity for
      the digital realm, I've honed my skills in content writing, web
      development, and game development. My journey includes contributions as a
      Content Writer for Green Team and ClickCric, as well as taking on the role
      of Executive Editorial at NUST ACM Student Chapter. Embracing the world of
      artificial intelligence, I expanded my horizons as an AI Intern at
      CodSoft. Beyond the realms of technology, my enthusiasm extends to the
      realm of education, where I've shared my knowledge as a Mathematics
      Teacher at GauthMath. Proficient in trigonometry, calculus, and linear
      algebra, I find joy in unraveling complex mathematical problems. Certified
      in AI For Everyone and Data Science Orientation from Coursera, I am
      committed to continuous learning and growth. In my free time, you can find
      me immersed in the pages of the Quran, exploring cinematic worlds through
      movies and TV shows, or enjoying the thrill of cricket and football—both
      as a player and an avid spectator. Let's connect and explore the endless
      possibilities that lie at the intersection of my skills and your needs.
